Web Design Project

📌 About

This project is a complete website design and development portfolio piece built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It was created for a client associated with the Connect Communities Initiative (CCI) and follows a structured development process through four work phases:

1. Initial planning and research

2. Client requirements and ethical analysis

3. Design and prototyping

4. Final implementation and deployment

The final result reflects a fully implemented site that demonstrates responsive layout, visual design principles, and practical front-end development skills.
