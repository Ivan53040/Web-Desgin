This project involves the development of a website demonstrating the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
The website was created for a client associated with the Connect Communities Initiative (CCI) group, taking into account their specific background and requirements.
The project consists of four work phases, progressing from initial planning to full implementation. 
It includes client needs analysis, as well as ethical analysis and decision-making prior to the development process.
The final product is presented in Work Phase 4, which reflects the complete implementation of the website.
