                    This brief has been prepared for the internal design teams
                    at Connect Communities Initiative (CCI). Each design team is
                    tasked with developing individual concepts and prototypes

                    area while adhering to our mission of inclusivity,
                    accessibility, and ethical design. Each website should also
                    celebrate the unique characteristics of its chosen community
