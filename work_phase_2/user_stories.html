                                            Yes, I’m really interested in trying
                                            other countries' food! Since coming
                                            to Australia, I’ve met people from
                                            many cultures—Korea, India, Vietnam,
                                            Italy—and I get curious about their
                                            food too. I love learning new
                                            flavors and ingredients I didn’t use
                                            before. But when I try cooking them,
                                            I care about a few things:
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>
                                                    1. How simple it is I’m
                                                    still learning to cook, so
                                                    if a recipe has too many
                                                    steps or uses tools I don’t
                                                    have, it’s hard. I like
                                                    simple recipes with everyday
                                                    ingredients.

                                                    2. Cost of ingredients Some
                                                    international ingredients
                                                    are expensive or hard to
                                                    find here. I always check if
                                                    I can use a substitute or if
                                                    the recipe is student-budget
                                                    friendly.

                                                    3. If the taste is authentic
                                                    I want to understand what
                                                    the *real* version tastes
                                                    like. Even if I can’t make
                                                    it perfect, I want to know
                                                    what makes it special—like
                                                    certain spices or sauces.
                                                    Sometimes I ask my friends
                                                    from that country to check
                                                    if I did it right!

                                                    to share it with people from
                                                    that culture. It’s nice to
                                                    see their reaction, and

                                            Oh yes, definitely! Since moving to
                                            Australia, I’ve had the chance to
                                            try foods from so many different
                                            cultures—Indian, Vietnamese, Greek,
                                            and more. I think food is a
                                            beautiful way to understand a
                                            country’s culture, and I’m always
                                            curious to explore new dishes. When
                                            it comes to cooking food from other
                                            countries, here’s what I care about
                                            the most:

                                                    Flexibility
                                                </li>
                                                I like to cook authentic dishes,
                                                but I understand that sometimes
                                                it’s hard to find the exact
                                                ingredients here in Australia.
                                                For example, I’ve tried making
                                                Mexican tacos, but some spices
                                                are just not available, so I
                                                have to find alternatives. I
                                                care about **keeping the
                                                essence** of the dish, but I
                                                also appreciate flexibility in
                                                the recipe.

                                                that are **simple**. I don't
                                                mind exploring new flavors, but
                                                I want the recipe to be
                                                something I can prepare in a
                                                reasonable amount of time,
                                                especially if I’m cooking for my
                                                family. - If the recipe requires
                                                too many exotic or complicated
                                                steps, I might skip it.

                                                vegetables and lean proteins.
                                                For example, if I’m cooking
                                                Italian pasta, I might look for
                                                ways to add more veggies like
                                                spinach or mushrooms.

                                                adapt it to make it something he
                                                would enjoy too. I care about

                                                **find the ingredients
                                                locally**—either at the
                                                supermarket or at an
                                                Asian/Indian store. I’d love to
                                                know if there are substitutions
                                                for hard-to-find ingredients
                                                that would still keep the dish
                                                tasting good.
                                                <li>6. Visual Inspiration</li>

                                                - I’m also inspired by how the
                                                dish looks. It doesn’t need to
                                                be fancy, but I do want to see
                                                how the food should look when
                                                it’s ready. If there’s a picture
                                                of the final dish, it helps me
                                                know I’m on the right track.
                                            </ul>
                                            In summary, I care about making the
                                            dish feel **authentic**, **simple**,
                                            **healthy**, and **kid-friendly**
                                            while making sure I can get the
                                            ingredients here in Australia. I
                                            enjoy cooking food from other
                                            cultures, but I want it to be
                                            something I can realistically
                                            prepare for my family.

                                                be invaluable. - It would be
                                                great to **find others based on
                                                similar backgrounds** (e.g.,

                                                ask questions like, “How do you
                                                cook for picky eaters?” or “What

                                                if there were **groups** by
                                                country or region, where we
                                                could share tips specific to
                                                migrants from France, or other

                                                really appreciate a platform
                                                that offers **language

                                                way, I can feel more confident
                                                joining conversations and
                                                connecting with others.

                                                A place where I can share
                                                recipes or cooking tips would be
                                                great. But I also care about
                                                seeing **feedback and support**
                                                from others—comments on what
                                                worked or ideas for
                                                improvements. - It would be nice
                                                to have a **recipe sharing
                                                section** where we can give
                                                advice on making dishes more
                                                family-friendly or healthy.
                                            </ul>
                                            So for me, the most important
                                            function would be a
                                            **community-driven space** where I
                                            can easily connect with others who
                                            share similar interests and
                                            experiences, especially when it
                                            comes to cooking, family, and being
                                            an expat. Having features to connect
                                            both virtually and in person would
                                            be key.

                                            Eating healthy is very important to
                                            me, especially now that we’re living
                                            in a new country and I’m responsible
                                            for preparing meals for my family. I
                                            want to make sure that my husband
                                            and son are getting the right
                                            nutrients, and that our meals are
                                            not only tasty but also good for us.
                                            I try to balance French dishes with
                                            healthy choices, but I also want to
                                            learn more about Australian
                                            ingredients and healthy ways of

                                            things tricky—I’m often interrupted,
                                            and I need simple recipes that don’t
                                            require too much attention.

                                                    Cooking: - **Ingredient
                                                    confusion**: Some
                                                    ingredients I’m familiar
                                                    with in French recipes are
                                                    hard to find in Australia.
                                                    I’ve had trouble finding
                                                    certain herbs or cheeses,
                                                    and I don’t always know the
                                                    local equivalents. - **Time

                                                    in the kitchen. Sometimes I
                                                    just want something quick,
                                                    easy, and healthy. -

                                                    French methods, but here, I
                                                    want to learn some
                                                    Australian twists, like
                                                    making healthier versions of

                                                These Are the Most Important

                                                Step-by-step visuals are
                                                essential. It would help if I
                                                could easily follow along. It’s
                                                also useful if I can pause and
                                                replay sections, especially if
                                                I’m distracted by my son! -

                                                like “how to chop onions
                                                properly” or “how to prepare a

                                                make it much easier to follow,
                                                even for a beginner.

                                                </li>
                                                I need **visual cues**—whether
                                                that’s seeing the exact size to
                                                chop vegetables or how the dish
                                                should look as it’s being
                                                cooked. For example, showing how
                                                much the food should brown or
                                                the texture of the sauce would
                                                help me gauge whether I’m doing
                                                it right.
                                                <li>3. Language Simplicity</li>
                                                It’s helpful if the language is
                                                simple and easy to understand,
                                                especially for me as a
                                                non-native English speaker. If
                                                the video had **French
                                                subtitles**, or simple English,
                                                that would be great! This would
                                                make the recipe less stressful
                                                and easier to follow.

                                                **Timing** is very important, so
                                                it’s helpful if the video
                                                includes how long each step
                                                takes. - I also prefer **exact
                                                measurements**, such as “1
                                                tablespoon of olive oil” or
                                                “100g of chicken,” rather than
                                                vague terms like “a little” or
                                                “some.”

                                                For example, can I use olive oil
                                                instead of butter? Or can I
                                                replace cream with yogurt? These
                                                kinds of tips are very useful to
                                                make the dish a little healthier
                                                without compromising the taste.
                                                - A section on **common
                                                mistakes** to avoid would also
                                                be nice. For example, “If your
                                                sauce is too runny, here’s how
                                                to fix it.”

                                                For example, “If you have picky
                                                eaters, try adding less garlic”
                                                or “You can blend these
                                                vegetables into the sauce for a
                                                smoother texture.” - It would be
                                                helpful if the video explained

                                                know what’s safe for him to
                                                do—like stirring, washing
                                                vegetables, or arranging things
                                                on a plate.
                                            </ul>
                                            If a cooking video included all of
                                            these elements, it would make the
                                            whole process less stressful and
                                            more enjoyable. I’d feel confident
                                            following along and be able to make
                                            something delicious without any
                                            confusion.

                                                    should have a few key

                                                    worthwhile. Here’s what I’d
                                                    say is most important:

                                                        </li>
                                                        People want to know
                                                        they’re cooking the real
                                                        deal, so recipes need to
                                                        be authentic. I’d say
                                                        it’s important to keep
                                                        the traditional aspects
                                                        of the recipe intact,
                                                        but also be clear about
                                                        how to make it at home
                                                        with ingredients that
                                                        might be easier to find.

                                                        instructions** are
                                                        crucial too, so people
                                                        know exactly how to
                                                        replicate the dish.

                                                        Some dishes require
                                                        specialized techniques.
                                                        For instance, I remember
                                                        trying to make **sushi**
                                                        for the first time. It
                                                        took me a while to get
                                                        the **rice**
                                                        right—**seasoning** it
                                                        just perfectly and
                                                        getting the texture
                                                        exactly as it should be.
                                                        It’s a delicate balance
                                                        of art and science, and

                                                        It’s important to see

                                                        slow. I don’t want to be

                                                        because the video rushed
                                                        through it too quickly.

                                                        instead, I focus on

                                                        frying chicken, you can
                                                        **grill** it, which
                                                        reduces the fat content
                                                        and keeps it just as
                                                        juicy. It’s about using

                                                        I think platforms can
                                                        play a huge role in
                                                        helping people learn how
                                                        to cook **healthier
                                                        versions** of their
                                                        favorite meals. It’d be
                                                        great to have access to
                                                        **simple, healthy
                                                        recipes**, along with
                                                        **tips on ingredient
                                                        substitutions**, and
                                                        **cooking techniques**
                                                        that don’t sacrifice
                                                        flavor for nutrition.

                                                    At the end of the day,
                                                    healthy eating is about
                                                    feeling good, not just
                                                    looking good. It’s about
                                                    **nourishing your body** so
                                                    you have the energy to enjoy
                                                    life, cook for your family,
                                                    and share meals with
                                                    friends. And as much as I
                                                    love a good meat pie, I
                                                    think I can find ways to
                                                    make it a little lighter and
                                                    still just as delicious!
