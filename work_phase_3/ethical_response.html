                            3. Use clear, checkbox-based consent for sensitive
                            data (e.g., ‚ÄúI agree to share this

                                        address mandatory. This allows users to
                                        subscribe without feeling pressured to
                                        disclose sensitive information.<br />

                                        2. Make Sensitive Fields Optional: All
                                        other questions‚Äîsuch as sexuality,
                                        income, and phone usage‚Äîshould be
                                        optional, with clear opt-in
                                        checkboxes.<br />

                                        3. Provide Transparent Justifications:
                                        Where optional data is requested,
                                        include simple explanations (e.g., ‚ÄúThis
                                        helps us understand our audience better,
                                        but is completely optional‚Äù).<br />

                                        4. Add Consent Mechanisms: Include
                                        checkbox consent for each category of
                                        optional data. This promotes autonomy
                                        and informed participation.<br />

                                        5. Data Minimization & Retention: Ensure
                                        that data is retained only as long as
                                        necessary and deleted when users
                                        unsubscribe.<br />

                                        This solution supports your funder's
                                        desire for data while protecting user
                                        autonomy, strengthening user confidence,
                                        and aligning with the ACS ethical
                                        standards.

                                        We understand that collecting richer
                                        data may be seen as essential for
                                        reporting outcomes to your funders.
                                        However, asking for too much personal
                                        data upfront‚Äîespecially without clear
                                        explanation‚Äîcan reduce engagement,
                                        particularly among users from

                                        deep respect for its diverse community.
                                        This will likely lead to higher opt-in
                                        rates, greater long-term trust, and
                                        positive brand recognition. Ethical
                                        design also positions your organization
