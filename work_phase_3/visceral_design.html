                            I used brown as the base colour for the my design.
                            The reason for this is that brown is a colour that
                            is associated with
                            <span

                            and welcoming space for all users, providing them
                            with a sense of comfort and security can encourge
                            them to revisit the site. <br />Moreover, the colour
                            brown also associated withe the

                            >, which also can relate to the

                        <p>
                            The font I used for the website is "Nunito",
                            sans-serif. As the website aims to be a
                            <span
                                style="
                                    font-weight: bold;
                                    background-color: yellow;
                                "
                                >welcoming and inclusive</span
                            >
                            space for all users, I chose this font because it is
                            a sans-serif font that is easy to read and has a
                            <span
                                style="
                                    font-weight: bold;
                                    background-color: yellow;
                                "
                                >friendly and approachable feel.</span
                            >
                            <br />The font is also modern and clean, which
                            aligns with the website's goal of promoting a
                            <span
                                style="
                                    font-weight: bold;
                                    background-color: yellow;
                                "
                                >healthy lifestyle.</span
                            >
                            <br />The font size follow the golden ratio, which
                            is a design principle that is often used in design
                            to create a sense of
                            <span
                                style="
                                    font-weight: bold;
                                    background-color: yellow;
                                "
                                >harmony and balance.</span
                            >
                            I set the font size in screen size to be 1rem and
                            mobile to be 0.75rem, and times 1.618 for the next
                            size. Up to 4.2 rem for screen size and 3.5rem for
                            mobile size. <br />This time I decided to change the
                            font weight only when needed to maintain the harmony
                            of the design. <br />The font weight is set to 400
                            for normal text and 700 for headings.
